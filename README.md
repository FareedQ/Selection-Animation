# Selection-Animation

This small project demonstrates an animation of one image and four other options. After a long press the other four options appear at the top of the screen. Dragging the cusor to the other options will switch the images. A few lines of code need to be added to make some flag change values based on the selection. The majority of the code is located in the ViewController.

This is only setup to work in the iPhone5 screen size. There are a few issues with constraints that don't allow the images to animate properly with other screensizes. Some refactoring and debugging will need to be done to correct that.
